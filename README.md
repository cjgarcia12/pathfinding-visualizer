# Pathfinding Visualizer

A React-based visualization tool for pathfinding algorithms, built with Vite. This interactive application demonstrates how different pathfinding algorithms traverse through a maze to find a path from start to end.

## Features

- Interactive maze generation
- Visualization of pathfinding algorithms:
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Real-time visualization of path exploration
- Customizable maze size

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cjgarcia12/pathfinding-visualizer
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Usage

1. The application will generate a random maze when loaded
2. Green cell represents the start point
3. Red cell represents the end point
4. Use the control buttons to:
   - Generate a new maze
   - Run BFS algorithm
   - Run DFS algorithm
5. Watch as the algorithm explores the maze to find the end point

## Built With

- React 18
- Vite
- CSS3
